# Chapter 1 - Identity Capital

Identity captial is your individual resources, degrees, skills that you use to purchase jobs, relationships, opportunities. It includes how you speak, where you come from, your networks, and how you present yourself. e.g. being socially adept, quick wit, a good communicator, empathetic.

Is an extended period of naval gazing in your 20s helpful? Some amount of identity crisis is, which is struggling to figure out what your identity is.

Identity capital and crisis go together:
* Too much capital, not enough crisis => rigid and conventional lives
* Too much crisis, not enough capital => disengaged confusion, danger of irrelevance

20s is a good time to explore and create commitments, to construct a stronger identity. This will increase self esteem, your ability to perserveve and be realistic, a clearer sense of self, increased life satisfaction/stress management/ (and with reflection) resistance to conformity. 

When making a choice of jobs, especially when underemployed, favor one that adds identity capital.

The most important identity capital is learning how to improve your capital. Take opportunities that allow you to improve your capital and learn to improve your capital. Use your current capital to purchase the next and larger opportunity, and to build the next piece of capital.

m: Just like with all capital, compounding is key.

# Chapter 2 - Weak Ties

Strong ties are your group who you spend much time with, and are very similar to, and speak a common language with that is highly efficient.

But most opportunities come from weak ties, because these link you into corners you cannot see around. Say yes to weak ties opportuntiies.
m: weak ties are higher entropy, and can move you farther from current state. Opportunities from weak ties are more likely to be outside your comfort zone, and hence more likely to lead to growth.

Strong ties are cliques, and can limit your thinking because of the sameness and self-reinforcement, it can seem that the whole world thinks this way when it is very different. Weak ties force elaborated communication, because you are communicating across larger differences, which require more context, greater organization, and thus more reflection.
