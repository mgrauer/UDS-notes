What do product managers do? What are their incentives?

PMs talk about getting wins for our customers when revenue increases. Selling more doesn't necessarily mean delighting our customers more.

We can say that we are delighting more customers based on increased revenue (quantitative) metrics. This may be an instantaneous or local sales win, but it might hurt long term customer value, or hurt the overall experience. One way to check this is to marry the quantitative with qualitative data, e.g. compare the experience of customers new to the site before and after the change.

Imagine you have a top of funnel change that results in driving more traffic overall downfunnel, but also results in some inconsistency between pages, because what the upfunnel page promised was revealed not to be fully correct. This can result in a confusing experience for customers, and also a loss of trust. Maybe you have greater purchasing because of the higher traffic, but higher exit rate as well on the downfunnel page, and some unmeasured loss in lifetime customer value. Is this a good tradeoff?

e.g., on a product grid or carousel, you can show the most popular options with the lowest price or fastest delivery speed. once the customer gets to the product details and configures the product as they like with options, the price or speed may be worse than expected.

Product management is a hard job because everyone is looking to you for answers in ambiguity. You are making tradeoffs in delivery between speed, what is right for the customer, and quality (scalability, maintainability). 

Your job is to be the voice of the customer. You need to help the customer and also help the business, but the reality is often skewed towards the business. Some of this in reflected in time constraints.

e.g., say you have an attachment for warranty offering modal. this might decrease revenue and conversion for some, but revenue overall is increased by the attachment. that could be ok, depending on LTV and how quickly you could refine to start to cut back when you show the modal--maybe don't show it for all products, and just find the set where it actually is right for the customer. But if this follow up work isn't pursued, you've now hurt the customer experience for the many, and your incentives may not encourage you to come back and do this work, e.g. your incentives are to go out and find other big wins.

What were incentives on the PDP?
* never hurt ATC and CVR
* don't clutter it, keep it clean
* take big swings, based on conviction, that would have big impact, instead of just learning
* learning was hard to justify

at the same time, we needed to keep the page fast (plus web vitals) and stable, a good and consistent customer experience, and allow for testing the space by many. there was a tension here, between being a good partner and keeping up page quality.

and when learning isn't rewarded, it's hard to justify the investment in building up a knowledgebase of previous test results, so there is a lot of lost information and repeated testing. no one is promoted for learning, and people are told early on to take big swings.

how would you incentivize learning in a product org?

there can be strong convictions coming down from the top, even when they are directly refuted by testing. this can damage morale in product, and initiative, and essentially you are just a project manager and ferrier of requirements.

what do middle manager product managers do? politic with each other? do they have a vision for their space that is laddered up to?

what are the different types of product manager cultures? do all product managers exist to shield the team?
